        At Legent, we’re all about making healthcare better. And that doesn’t
        just mean that we focus on getting you the best possible treatment using
        the latest technology, but on all the little things too, from
        super-friendly service to comfortable rooms with food so good you’ll
        (almost) forget you’re in hospital.
